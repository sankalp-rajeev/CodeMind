# Evaluation dependencies (in addition to main requirements.txt)
# Run from project root: pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -r evaluation/requirements.txt

# Already in main requirements:
# ollama, chromadb, sentence-transformers, rank-bm25, crewai, fastapi, etc.

# Evaluation-specific (minimal - most come from main)
# No additional packages required if main requirements are installed
